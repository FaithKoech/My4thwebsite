<h1>Python</h1>
<p>Python is a programming language that is used for web development (server-side), software development, mathematics and system scripting.</p>
<P>It works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc) and has a simple syntax similar to the English language that
  allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. It can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.</P>
