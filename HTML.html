<h1>Lessons From HTML CLass</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It describes the structure of a Web page.
  HTML consists of a series of elements represented by tags that tell the browser how to display the content.
  These tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page
</p>
<p>All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration:
  <!DOCTYPE html> and HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
  The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.</p>
